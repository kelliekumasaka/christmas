Our family had\n      the privilege of visiting London and Paris together (don’t worry this was before the bed bug\n      debacle…). We ate our weight in croissants, spent 8+ hours at the Harry Potter Studio, popped\n      champagne beneath the Eiffel Tower, snapped a selfie with Mona Lisa, and generally made\n      fools of ourselves as typical American tourists! Kellie, Jill and I also spent time traveling to Spain\n      and Portugal! Well, actually, I had to return back to the states before the Portugal leg of the trip\n      as *some* of us were hardworking students during that time with no such thing as “unlimited\n      PTO” and “funemployment”…\n      </p>\n      <h3>BHK:</h3>\n      <p>\n      Speaking of funemployment…I’m just kidding our dad is STILL working but if you want to\n      get an appointment with one of Valley’s best dermatologists, it’ll probably be a very long wait\n      as this hardworking doc enjoys his 4-day weekends! Dubbie’s 2023 has been filled with lots of\n      golfing, miraculously realizing golf should be fun, running (including a 5k in Central Park!),\n      getting hurt while running, making a somewhat full recovery, then proceeding to run again,\n      vibing with his bff Bruno Mars in Las Vegas, organizing a family NHL Fantasy League, and of\n      course, going to Kraken, Mariners, and Huskies games!\n      </p>\n      <h3>SMK:</h3>\n      <p>\n        Our mother is hard at work in her KDECWMTAKDBMJS (Korean Drama Enthusiasts Club\n        Who Meet and Talk About Korean Dramas But Mostly Just Socialize)! When she’s not picking up\n        my FaceTime calls to ask her if it’s safe to eat my expired food, she’s picking up Jill’s FaceTime\n        calls to listen to her rant about the “hardest test of her life.” She is also keeping busy staying\n        involved with Presby by teaching Sunday School for the cutest 2-3 y/o’s and serving as a\n        deacon. What my mom is most looking forward to in 2024: being an empty nester! I feel like\n        we’ve been saying our parents will be empty nesters in every Christmas letter since 2019…but\n        we’re serious this time.\n      </p>\n      <h3>KHK:</h3>\n      <p>\n        This was arguably the most important year for our beloved, Keloid. As you IG followers\n        know, Kellie got engaged this year to the one and only skater boi Nyle Miura, who\n        (unfortunately for him but fortunately for us) will be committing his life to handle the terrifying\n        while hangry bundle of joy that is my older sister! We are eternally grateful Nyle. Kellie was\n        quite the world traveler this year spending time in Mexico, Spain, Portugal, and Japan! She says,\n        and I quote, “Spain was probably the best trip since my dearest sister Lisa was traveling with\n        me.” Bless her soul. I’m not adding anything about her work since I’m not quite sure what her\n        job entails other than sitting in front of a computer from 8am-5pm and making sure her\n        website doesn’t crash?...\n      </p>\n      <h3>LTK:</h3>\n      <p>\n        Well, as for your humble author not a lot has changed…I could pretty much just copy and\n        paste from last year’s letter, but since you all skipped the first half of this letter to jump down\n        to my paragraph, I might as well update you! I am currently in my MCR (Master of Clinical\n        Research) year in between my second and third year of medical school. I’ve spent most of this\n        year in lab running experiments or organizing events like the Asian Pacific American Medical\n        Student Association National Conference! I most recently traveled to Philly to attend the Kidney\n        Week conference! Just imagine 12,000 nerdy, kidney enthusiasts + some cheesesteaks + the Liberty Bell and that just about sums it up! ALSO, I adopted a bb husky in March, Kaia, who has\n        kept me on my toes and has substantially increased my daily average steps.\n      </p>\n      <h3>JKK:</h3>\n      <p>\n        As for my younger sister, she missed me so much the past 2 years that she decided to\n        follow me to good ol’ P-town and matriculate at Oregon Health &amp; Science University School of\n        Medicine and is now a member of the MD/MPH class of 2028! I would say she is “surviving not\n        thriving”, as I think most med students would describe their usual day-to-day vibes. Before\n        starting at OHSU, Jill was livin’ the good life and by that, I mean the rent free, home-cooked\n        meals good life. She worked as a medical scribe before starting at OHSU and spent a bit time of\n        time traveling to New York along with the other family vacations!\n      </p>\n      <h3>LPWK (Luna Poona Woona Kumasaka):</h3>\n      <p>\n        Ok, now I can ACTUALLY copy and paste from last year’s\n        letter…Luna, our precious, mustache-toting, socially inept, labradoodle is doing just fine. She\n        enjoys her naps in the sun, being Kellie’s only WFH co-worker, and running!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Well, that’s a wrap for 2023!
