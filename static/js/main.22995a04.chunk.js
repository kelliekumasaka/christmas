Kellie, Jill and I also spent time traveling to Spain and Portugal!

Dubbie\u2019s 2023 has been filled with lots of golfing, miraculously realizing golf should be fun, running (including a 5k in Central Park!), getting hurt while running, making a somewhat full recovery, then proceeding to run again, vibing with his bff Bruno Mars in Las Vegas, organizing a family NHL Fantasy League, and of course, going to Kraken, Mariners, and Huskies games!"}),Object(r.jsx)("h3",{children:"SMK:"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"Our mother is hard at work in her KDECWMTAKDBMJS (Korean Drama Enthusiasts Club Who Meet and Talk About Korean Dramas But Mostly Just Socialize)!
