But\n        after one long year of waiting, I’M BACK BABY. That’s right folks, your\n        author this year, brought back one year sooner than usual by popular\n        demand (and because my parents forgot -_-) is Jill. In 2022, my family\n        embraced technology to its fullest with solar panels for the house, a\n        new fully electric car, and Fubo TV. We also acquired a younger Japanese\n        brother, which, unlike everything else in this letter, is not a joke!\n        Hanamichi, our cousin from Japan, started living with us in July and has\n        been a great addition to the chaos of our household.\n      </p>\n      <h3>DUBBIE:</h3>\n      <p>\n        My father turned 60 this year and celebrated with the “Bandon Boys”\n        which is basically a bad middle- aged boyband that golfs and drinks\n        whiskey. Dubbie also went flyfishing for the first time in 40 years with\n        his favorite brother which he describes as, “truly one of the biggest\n        thrills this year.” Oh, to be old and enjoying “thrilling” activities\n        like golfing and fly fishing. He is enjoying his transition to part-time\n        dermatologist at Valley Medical (as if he ever worked in the first\n        place), golfing, and cheering for Seattle sports teams.\n      </p>\n      <h3>MUBBIE:</h3>\n      <p>\n        Mother is as active as ever. She enjoys teaching her Sunday school\n        lessons featuring embarrassing stories of her daughters and serving as a\n        deacon. Throughout this year, you could find Mubbie either cheering for\n        the Mariners in the living room or golfing with Auntie Wendy or Julie or\n        Leslie or Marji or all the above. Her 2022 highlights include taking\n        selfies with Stormtroopers on Rise of the Resistance, watching kdrama,\n        and spending time with her favorite daughter (not to be confused with\n        the other daughter who lives with her, Kellie).\n      </p>\n      <h3>KIWI:</h3>\n      <p>\n        Everyone’s least favorite sister had an eventful year: she saw Twice\n        twice, caught COVID in Toronto, and got a job, got a job, quit a job,\n        and got a job (if you’re confused by that last part then that makes two\n        of us). She is now working from home as a software engineer for a\n        shipping tracking company called Logixboard. Kellie often complains that\n        her one and only in-office coworker smells bad and makes too much noise,\n        but Luna claims otherwise. Kiwi is also tutoring students in the\n        computer science boot camp she completed last year. Overall, she stays\n        busy buying Pokémon cards, bullet journaling, and hanging out with\n        friends.\n      </p>\n      <h3>TOW TOW:</h3>\n      <p>\n        Lisa is pretending to study at OHSU in her second year of Medical\n        School. She is also single- handedly solving medical racism and finding\n        the cure to cancer, or at least that’s what it seems like. Tow Tow is\n        the swollest in the PNW and can squat the equivalent of two Kiwi’s + one\n        Luna, you do the math. This year, she moved to a new house, led OHSU’s\n        Health Care Equity Fair, and stitched up a knife wound! She also\n        fulfilled her vigilante dreams and almost died, but that’s a story for\n        another time.\n      </p>\n      <h3>JEEL:</h3>\n      <p>\n        Onto the important stuff. This year I saw Twice once, travelled across\n        the country with my father (and survived!), and skydived in Hawaii. In\n        January, I moved to Atlanta for six months to work for the CDC. While in\n        Atlanta, I also started working as a barista where I “developed a\n        passion for coffee” which my family interprets as “became a coffee\n        snob.” I am currently pursuing an original and very foreign profession\n        to our family (medicine) and working as a medical scribe for the best\n        doctor in Des Moines (ily Dr. Okamoto).\n      </p>\n      <h3>LUNA:</h3>\n      <p>\n        Luna is… the same: fuzzy, lazy, and stinky. Her hobbies of 2022 included\n        harassing children, barking at cats, and scratching herself.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Well, that’s a wrap people! If you enjoyed this year’s newsletter,\n        please kindly remind my supervisors to give their workers a raise.\n        Thanks again for tuning in and happy holidays!\n      </p>\n      <p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>With love,</p>\n      <p style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>The Kumasakas</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Letter;","import './App.css';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Home from \"./components/Home/Home\"\nimport Letter from \"./components/Letter/Letter\"\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Home/>\n      <Letter/>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/final.bd76b184.png\";","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\nimport \"../node_modules/uikit/dist/js/uikit.min.js\";\nimport \"../node_modules/uikit/dist/css/uikit.min.css\";\nimport UIkit from \"uikit\";\nimport Icons from \"uikit/dist/js/uikit-icons\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\nimport Snowfall from \"react-snowfall\";\nimport dub3 from \"./images/final.png\"\n\nconst snowflake3 = document.createElement(\"img\");\nsnowflake3.src = dub3;\n\nconst images = [snowflake3];\n\nUIkit.use(Icons);\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <div style={{ background: \"#282c34\" }}>\n      <Snowfall\n        snowflakeCount={20}\n        style={{\n          position: \"fixed\",\n          width: \"100%\",\n          height: \"100%\",\n        }}\n        speed={[0.1, 0.3]}\n        wind={[-0.5,1.0]}\n      />\n      <Snowfall\n        snowflakeCount={1}\n        style={{\n          position: \"fixed\",\n          width: \"100%\",\n          height: \"100%\",\n        }}\n        images={images}\n        radius={[20.0, 30.0]}\n        speed={[0.1, 0.3]}\n        wind={[-0.5,1.0]}\n      />\n      <App />\n    </div>\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
