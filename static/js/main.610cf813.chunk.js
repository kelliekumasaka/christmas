When he\u2019s not running, he\u2019s usually out on the golf course. Not sure if this is an exaggeration but it seemed like he was out of state on a golf trip at least once a month. And once again, we were able to mourn together the decline of the 2024 Mariner\u2019s season where they failed to make the playoffs again.

When I think of her, the word \u201cgratitude\u201d is the first that comes to mind. Since this was her first year as an empty nester, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been a much quieter year overall.

Other than picking up lunches for her senior medical staff members, I imagine her day to day is some combination of walking her big dog Kaia (seriously this dog is bigger than Kellie), research, helping save lives, and receiving zero compensation. One of the best stories from this year involved her and I in Korea. Us and Kellie were on our way to the Hanbok photoshoot. When the bus arrived, Kellie proceeded to get on the bus, but Lisa and I were denied entry because we had coffees in hand. There was a slight delay in panic and before we knew it, the doors had closed, Kellie was on the bus alone as it drove away, and Lisa and I were chasing it on the streets of Seoul!

In our most recent trip to Japan, we spent a lot of time eating, exploring, and shopping together. One funny story from Japan (that I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s aware of), was that she bought this specific pair of jeans from a store called \u201cGU\u201d. She seemed really excited about it. After she had gone back to the states, Kellie and I were still in Japan and had decided to stop by \u201cGU\u201d one more time.
