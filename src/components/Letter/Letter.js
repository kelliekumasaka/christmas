            2020 and 2021 brought several things: the COVID pandemic, social distancing, and two incredibly forgettable
            Kumasaka newsletters. But after two long years of waiting, I’M BACK BABY. That’s right folks, your author this
            year is Jill. In 2022, my family embraced technology to its fullest with solar panels for the house, a new fully
            electric car, and Fubo TV. We also acquired a younger Japanese brother, which, unlike everything else in this
            letter, is not a joke! Hanamichi, our cousin from Japan, started living with us in July and has been a great
            addition to the chaos of our household.

            <h3>DUBBIE:</h3>
            <p>
                My father turned 60 this year and celebrated with the “Bandon Boys” which is basically a bad middle-
                aged boyband that golfs and drinks whiskey. Dubbie also went flyfishing for the first time in 40 years with his
                favorite brother which he describes as, “truly one of the biggest thrills this year.” Oh, to be old and enjoying
                “thrilling” activities like golfing and fly fishing. He is enjoying his transition to part-time dermatologist at Valley
                Medical (as if he ever worked in the first place), golfing, and cheering for Seattle sports teams.
            </p>
            <h3>MUBBIE:</h3>
            <p>
                Mother is as active as ever. She enjoys teaching her Sunday school lessons featuring embarrassing
                stories of her daughters and serving as a deacon. Throughout this year, you could find Mubbie either cheering
                for the Mariners in the living room or golfing with Auntie Wendy or Julie or Leslie or Marji or all the above. Her
                2022 highlights include taking selfies with Stormtroopers on Rise of the Resistance, watching kdrama, and
                spending time with her favorite daughter (not to be confused with the other daughter who lives with her, Kellie).
            </p>
            <h3>KIWI:</h3>
            <p>
                Everyone’s least favorite sister had an eventful year: she saw Twice twice, caught COVID in Toronto,
                and got a job, got a job, quit a job, and got a job (if you’re confused by that last part then that makes two of us).
                She is now working from home as a software engineer for a shipping tracking company called Logixboard.
                Kellie often complains that her one and only in-office coworker smells bad and makes too much noise, but
                Luna claims otherwise. Kiwi is also tutoring students in the computer science boot camp she completed last
                year. Overall, she stays busy buying Pokémon cards, bullet journaling, and hanging out with friends.
            </p>
            <h3>TOW TOW:</h3>
            <p>
                This year, Lisa has had quite an eventful year. Even in the midst of the ever-changing pandemic situation, Lisa managed to make her way to Montenegro-Croatia-Greece, then to Chicago, and finally, to New York. Oh yeah, and she started med school at Oregon Health & Science University, is a lead for the healthcare equity fair, and a co-lead for the Christian Medical and Dental Association... Work hard play hard I guess? 
            </p>
            <h3>JEEL:</h3>
            <p>
                Onto the important stuff. This year I saw Twice once, travelled across the country with my father (and
                survived!), and skydived in Hawaii. In January, I moved to Atlanta for six months to work for the CDC. While in
                Atlanta, I also started working as a barista where I “developed a passion for coffee” which my family interprets
                as “became a coffee snob.” I am currently pursuing an original and very foreign profession to our family
                (medicine) and working as a medical scribe for the best doctor in Des Moines (ily Dr. Okamoto).
            </p>
            <h3>LUNA:</h3>
            <p>
                Luna is… the same: fuzzy, lazy, and stinky. Her hobbies of 2022 include harassing children, barking at cats, and scratching herself.
            </p>

                Well, that’s a wrap people! If you enjoyed this year’s newsletter, please kindly remind my supervisors to give their workers a raise. Thanks again for tuning in and happy holidays!
            </p>

                With love,
                The Kumasakas
