      Well, strap in folks because it has been QUITE the year for the Kumasaka family! Our family had
      the privilege of visiting London and Paris together (don’t worry this was before the bed bug
      debacle…). We ate our weight in croissants, spent 8+ hours at the Harry Potter Studio, popped
      champagne beneath the Eiffel Tower, snapped a selfie with Mona Lisa, and generally made
      fools of ourselves as typical American tourists! Kellie, Jill and I also spent time traveling to Spain
      and Portugal! Well, actually, I had to return back to the states before the Portugal leg of the trip
      as *some* of us were hardworking students during that time with no such thing as “unlimited
      PTO” and “funemployment”…
      </p>
      <h3>BHK:</h3>
      <p>
      Speaking of funemployment…I’m just kidding our dad is STILL working but if you want to
      get an appointment with one of Valley’s best dermatologists, it’ll probably be a very long wait
      as this hardworking doc enjoys his 4-day weekends! Dubbie’s 2023 has been filled with lots of
      golfing, miraculously realizing golf should be fun, running (including a 5k in Central Park!),
      getting hurt while running, making a somewhat full recovery, then proceeding to run again,
      vibing with his bff Bruno Mars in Las Vegas, organizing a family NHL Fantasy League, and of
      course, going to Kraken, Mariners, and Huskies games!

        Our mother is hard at work in her KDECWMTAKDBMJS (Korean Drama Enthusiasts Club
        Who Meet and Talk About Korean Dramas But Mostly Just Socialize)! When she’s not picking up
        my FaceTime calls to ask her if it’s safe to eat my expired food, she’s picking up Jill’s FaceTime
        calls to listen to her rant about the “hardest test of her life.” She is also keeping busy staying
        involved with Presby by teaching Sunday School for the cutest 2-3 y/o’s and serving as a
        deacon. What my mom is most looking forward to in 2024: being an empty nester! I feel like
        we’ve been saying our parents will be empty nesters in every Christmas letter since 2019…but
        we’re serious this time.
      </p>
      <h3>KHK:</h3>
      <p>
        This was arguably the most important year for our beloved, Keloid. As you IG followers
        know, Kellie got engaged this year to the one and only skater boi Nyle Miura, who
        (unfortunately for him but fortunately for us) will be committing his life to handle the terrifying
        while hangry bundle of joy that is my older sister! We are eternally grateful Nyle. Kellie was
        quite the world traveler this year spending time in Mexico, Spain, Portugal, and Japan! She says,
        and I quote, “Spain was probably the best trip since my dearest sister Lisa was traveling with
        me.” Bless her soul. I’m not adding anything about her work since I’m not quite sure what her
        job entails other than sitting in front of a computer from 8am-5pm and making sure her
        website doesn’t crash?...
      </p>
      <h3>TOW TOW:</h3>
      <p>
        Well, as for your humble author not a lot has changed…I could pretty much just copy and
        paste from last year’s letter, but since you all skipped the first half of this letter to jump down
        to my paragraph, I might as well update you! I am currently in my MCR (Master of Clinical
        Research) year in between my second and third year of medical school. I’ve spent most of this
        year in lab running experiments or organizing events like the Asian Pacific American Medical
        Student Association National Conference! I most recently traveled to Philly to attend the Kidney
        Week conference! Just imagine 12,000 nerdy, kidney enthusiasts + some cheesesteaks + the Liberty Bell and that just about sums it up! ALSO, I adopted a bb husky in March, Kaia, who has
        kept me on my toes and has substantially increased my daily average steps.
      </p>
      <h3>JKK:</h3>
      <p>
        As for my younger sister, she missed me so much the past 2 years that she decided to
        follow me to good ol’ P-town and matriculate at Oregon Health &amp; Science University School of
        Medicine and is now a member of the MD/MPH class of 2028! I would say she is “surviving not
        thriving”, as I think most med students would describe their usual day-to-day vibes. Before
        starting at OHSU, Jill was livin’ the good life and by that, I mean the rent free, home-cooked
        meals good life. She worked as a medical scribe before starting at OHSU and spent a bit time of
        time traveling to New York along with the other family vacations!

      <h3>LPWK (Luna Poona Woona Kumasaka):</h3>
      <p>
        Ok, now I can ACTUALLY copy and paste from last year’s
        letter…Luna, our precious, mustache-toting, socially inept, labradoodle is doing just fine. She
        enjoys her naps in the sun, being Kellie’s only WFH co-worker, and running!
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that’s a wrap for 2023! Happy Christmas and Merry New Year!
      </p>
